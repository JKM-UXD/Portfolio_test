        I adjusted the code for my purpose (e.g., animation from top to bottom and reversed; menu links aligned in the middle)

                                <p class="aboutMeText">From a young age on I wanted to do something related to graphic design or media design. 
                                Later in the final years of high school I started developing interest in Psychology. From then on, I wanted to study psychology because I was really interested in how and why people think and behave. In general, I was also the kind of person who was really investigative and curious on 
                                how things work. Shortly before graduating from high-school my mom went on a sailing trip. Now, you might ask yourself how this is related either to UX Design and me. Coincidentally, my mother met a woman on the ship who was working as a (*drumroll*) UX Designer! After returning from her journey, my mother told me all about UX Design (I still believe that I would not have never discovered it, if it wasn’t for that trip). I realised that instead of studying plain psychology, that job would combine both my interests in psychology and design. Therefore, I went on searching for an optimal study program related to UX which eventually led me to The Hague University of Applied Sciences. But before I moved to the Netherlands, I took a gap year in which I was working at a supermarket as preparation for the move. Additionally, I was studying computer science and sociology at my local university. Finally, a year later I moved to the Netherlands and started my studies in UX Design in September 2020. Currently I am almost at the end of the first semester and fully focused on what’s to come.<br>
                                Outside of studying UX I am very interested in both sports and fitness. I am a major football (soccer) fan and follower of the NBA. I play football and basketball myself and do calisthenics. Other than that, I am very interested in music. I play and played guitar as well as drums from a young age on. With the big band of my school, I played internally and externally infront of mayor audiences.</p>
